Requirements To run this shell, you will need a Unix-based operating system and a C compiler. The following tools and libraries are also required:

GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 codes use the Betty style. The simple shell has no known memory leaks

Installation Clone this repository onto your local machine.
cd in to the cloned directory: cd simple_shell

Create an executable using: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

Run the shell program. either in interative mode ./hsh or non-interactive mode echo "pwd" | ./hsh

Examples Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh /bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found $ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh /bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found $ Same error with our program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh ./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found $ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh ./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found $

Usage

This shell supports basic Unix commands and features, including:

Running executables in the current directory or in directories listed in the PATH environment variable. Command line arguments. Piping between commands. Input/output redirection using the '<' and '>' characters. To exit the shell, type exit
